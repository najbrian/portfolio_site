            <p>Hello! I'm Brian, and I am a full-stack software developer. Why full stack? Because I enjoy frontend development just as much as backend development! I love solving problems, and each solution is like adding a Lego piece to the final product.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I started my career as a project/program manager in various industries, including e-discovery, e-commerce, and tech companies such as LinkedIn. During my time as a PM, I acquired many skills that are transferable to the world of coding. With my experience on the business side, I understand how crucial turnaround time is, how to have meaningful and efficient conversations about jobs to be done, and how to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>
            <br />
            <p>After my years in program management, I realized that I truly have a passion for creativity and problem-solving. I enjoy being challenged, testing my limits, and constantly learning. I love experimenting, discovering what works and what doesnâ€™t, learning from my peers, and witnessing how their creativity shines.</p>
            <br />
            <p>This realization led me to invest in myself by enrolling in General Assembly's three-month immersive software engineering bootcamp. I successfully graduated and am now looking to start my journey as a software developer.</p>
